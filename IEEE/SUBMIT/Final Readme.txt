Our final submission and code can be found online in our public GitHub repository:

https://github.com/tikimcfee/MapReduceInGo/

It includes:
* Our IEEE standard report format in its current state, labeled ‘Final Report’.
* Our source code, and comparison code.
* A windows executable batch file within 'src' to execute our experiments
* an 'old_input' folder to be used strictly with the set of 64 to 4096 input files by moving into the main src directory.
** A new inclusion, MapReduce_slow.go, is an attempt by the group for a new implementation of sub-mapped parsing, mentioned in the final report.
